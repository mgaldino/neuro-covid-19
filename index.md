### Literature Review

Kossowska, Szwed and Czarnek (2021) argues that the Covid-19 pandemic may have increased political identity salience. Rosenfeld and Tomiyama (2020), on the other hand, found that the pandemic did not change ideology, only atitudes, by making people more socially conservative (cnforming more strongly to traditional gender roles).

Calvillo et. al (2020) found that political ideology predicted percepetions of the threat of Covid-19. 

# Conspiracy Theories

Current researh in psichology suggests that at least three distinctive motives drive belief in conspiracy theory (Doulgas, Sutton and Cichocka, 2017): epistemic (the need to understand what is happeing in a given enviroment), existential (the absece of control may trigger believing in conspiracy to provide some sense of control) and social, in the sense of keeping a good socoail image ofthe self and the group.(?) There isn't much evidence that ideology will be an important predictor of conspiracy theory (?), altough it is correlated with low lever of education, which is, by its turn, a predictor of ideology (Douglas, Sutton, Callan, Dawtry, & Harvey, 2016).

Whe considering the epistemic motives and how psichology factors are associedated with ideology, we do not expect that ideologically diverse people will have differente epistemic needs. [explain]

When considering existential motives, it is expected that conservative people will be more prone to believe in conspiracy theory. Threat psoed by a pandemic in which there is no drug creates a lack of instrumental control. Since conservatives experience more anxiety in uncertain situations, ideology could be a moderator variable of the probability ot believe in conspiracy theory. The SCM for this specific causal path would be: Covid-19 -> anxiety -> belief in conspiracy theory
