## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mgaldino/neuro-covid-19/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mgaldino/neuro-covid-19/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Literature Review

Kossowska, Szwed and Czarnek (2021) argues that the Covid-19 pandemic may have increased political identity salience. Rosenfeld and Tomiyama (2020), on the other hand, found that the pandemic did not change ideology, only atitudes, by making people more socially conservative (cnforming more strongly to traditional gender roles).
